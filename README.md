<H1>Zoom Integrate With PHP</H1>
<p>I’m developing an online platform using PHP. here we will have multiple teachers and multiple students.
so teachers can create multiple events [meetings] and can join students who accepted it. like

Teacher x → create event → have 20 students

Teacher y → create event → have 40 students

And we may have more meetings same time. so we can’t host all. teacher can host meeting and forward.</p>
